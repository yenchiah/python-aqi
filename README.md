A library to convert between AQI value and pollutant concentration (µg/m³ or ppm) using the following algorithms:

This local python library is modified from [here](https://github.com/hrbonz/python-aqi), and the breakpoints are updated based on [EPA's AQI breakpoints](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codetables/aqi_breakpoints.html).

For how to compute AQI, refer to [EPA's guideline](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P1006KOQ.PDF?Dockey=P1006KOQ.PDF).
